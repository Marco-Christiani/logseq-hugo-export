  + ## Doughnut Chart

    + In my opinion, a far better version of a pie chart

    + A doughnut (or donut) chart is a pie chart with a "hole" - a blank circular area in the center. The chart is divided into parts that show the percentage each value contributes to a total.

    + Like the regular pie chart, the doughnut chart is used with small sets of data to compare categories. It drives attention from the area taken by each part to emphasize the length of arcs. The blank space also allows displaying some additional information in the center: for example, labels, the name of a selected category, or the chart title.

  + ## Tree Map


    + I personally use this chart with caution, as I believe there are better alternatives as it can be difficult to read and--more importantly--it can be difficult to gain insight with just a quick glance. Nevertheless, it is quite popular.

    + A treemap is a visualization that displays hierarchically organized data as a set of nested rectangles, parent elements being tiled with their child elements. The sizes and colors of rectangles are proportional to the values of the data points they represent.

  + ## Quadrant Chart


    + A quadrant chart is a scatter chart divided into four quarters to make the visualization more readable.

    + A great way to enhance a scatter plot by conveying more information at a glance.

  + ## Box (and Whisker) Chart


    + A fundamental chart, most common variation is the Box and Whisker
